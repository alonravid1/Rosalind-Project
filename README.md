# Rosalind Project
This is my collection of solutions to problems presented at [the Rosalind Project](URL 'https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/'), which are computational and/or biological problems. These problems are often given additional context of history and use, and are formatted clearly with a given input and desired output. The user then uploads their output and is told if it is correct or not.

The main library I use is the bio.py file, in which I have concentrated the more general use functions which I have written so far.
Some of my earlier solutions are not as well written or documented, but since they are trivial I did not go back to edit them yet, instead focusing on making sure the library is and working on more advanced problems.
