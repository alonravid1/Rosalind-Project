# Rosalind Project
This is my collection of solutions to problems presented at [the Rosalind Project](URL 'https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/'), which presents computational and computational-biological problems, in a clear format of given input and desired output. The user then uploads their output and is told if it is correct or not.

The main library of useful function I use is the bio.py file, in which I have concentrated the most general use and useful functions.
Some of my earlier solutions are not as well written or documented, but as they are trivial I did not go back to edit them yet, instead focusing on making sure the library is.
